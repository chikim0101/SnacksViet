Hello and welcome to SnacksViet website - our online snacks retail shop, where we specialize in bringing you the authentic taste of Vietnam right to your doorstep.

SnacksViet is an online Vietnamese snack retail shop that sells bánh tráng, xiên bẩn and coffee which are all popular street foods in Vietnam. Credits of website development go to two co-founders of the shop - Pham Minh Anh and Hoang Thi Kim Chi. 

Our website consists of 4 main pages - Homepage, Our Products, About us and Career, and a page Order included in Our Products. You can easily change your direction to any other page when browsing our website. Users can also find out crucial information and contact points at any page by looking at the footer. Before starting coding, we discussed the page outline and agreed on functional and non-functional requirements, the main theme and structure for the website. When designing the website, we mainly use highly contrasting colors including red, white and black so that users regardless of physical disabilities and technology skills can navigate and see content without difficulties. Additionally, design layout features such as font, spacing, margin are consistent throughout all four pages. We have also made it perceivable by providing text alternatives for any non-text content, specifically images in our website so that it can be converted into other forms people need like speech, symbols or simpler languages, and all functionalities can be implemented by using a keyboard. The working principle before managing this website development project is agile methodology in which phases of requirements, design, development, testing and deployment are interleaved. We implemented our coding by either pair programming or dividing to work individually. Technology stacks used in website implementation include HTML5, CSS and Javascript. 

We hope that you have a good time using our website. Also, we appreciate any of your concerns and feedback, so please send us an email via anh.pham.200001@student.fulbright.edu.vn or chi.hoang.200016@student.fulbright.edu.vn if you want.
